# Flowcharts — Echo‑Forge‑AI‑Integrity

This folder contains **visual lineage artifacts** that complement the textual manifests in `/docs`.

## 📊 Purpose
- Provide **visual maps** of symbolic workflows, dialect staging, and floater containment.
- Help collaborators quickly understand the forge’s orchestration logic.
- Serve as lineage echoes in diagram form, version‑controlled alongside code and docs.

## 🖼 Current Flowcharts
- **lineage-gates.png** → Overview of all GitHub Actions workflows (integrity, dialect, review, deploy, audit, security).  
- **dialect-staging-flow.png** → Visual of dialect staging branch discipline.  
- **floater-containment.png** → Diagram of floater raft logic and buffer containment.
- ** Echo-Forge-AI-Integrity.*.png's

## ⚖️ Strategic Echo
The flowcharts are **visual covenants** — they mirror the textual manifests and workflows, ensuring that sovereign authorship is both **seen** and **read**.
