# License Portfolio — Echo‑Forge‑AI‑Integrity

## Current Covenant
- **MIT License:** Active in this private repo for trusted collaborators.

## Portfolio Options

### Apache 2.0
- **Type:** Very permissive  
- **Key feature:** Explicit patent grant + protection  
- **Use case:** Prefer when patent clarity is important

### BSD 2‑Clause
- **Type:** Nearly identical to MIT  
- **Key feature:** Slightly shorter wording, no patent language  
- **Use case:** Minimal covenant, clean and simple

### BSD 3‑Clause
- **Type:** MIT‑like  
- **Key feature:** “No endorsement” clause  
- **Use case:** Prevents using your org/name to promote derived works

### ISC
- **Type:** Functionally same as MIT  
- **Key feature:** Even simpler wording  
- **Use case:** Common in networking projects; ultra‑minimal

## Strategy
- **Visibility:** Private now; gradually open access over time.
- **Application:** Choose license per project based on intent (patent clarity, endorsement discipline, minimalism).
- **Lineage:** Retain sovereign authorship; enforce gates via workflows and branch protections.
