## 📬 Reporting a Vulnerability
If you discover a security issue in this repository:

- Please **do not open a public issue**.  
- Instead, email: security@for-you-foundation.org (or your chosen contact).  
- Include a clear description, reproduction steps, and potential impact.

## ⚖️ Stewardship Principles
- **Confidentiality** → All reports are handled privately until resolved.  
- **Integrity** → Fixes are logged as lineage events with explicit commit messages.  
- **Continuity** → Each remediation is appended to this file as a covenant echo.  

---

## 🌀 Audit Loop Integration
- **Repo** → Fix committed with signed commit.  
- **Docs** → Update protocol if needed.  
- **Flowcharts** → Add lineage artifact if systemic.  
- **Wiki** → Teach the remediation as a ritual echo.
