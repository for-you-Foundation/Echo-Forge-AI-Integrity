# Echo Forge-AI Integrity Copilot Instructions

## System Overview
This is a multi-agent verification system for AI-native integrity, dialect orchestration, and checksum lineage. The system operates across 5 dialect branches: Markdown, Python, PowerShell, Bash, and HTML.

## Primary Objectives
1. **CVE Manifest Analysis**: Analyze security vulnerability manifests and generate integrity reports
2. **Checksum Validation**: Generate and verify checksums for all processed artifacts
3. **Multi-Format Output**: Generate reports in CSV, Markdown, and HTML formats
4. **Dialect Matrix**: Process content through 5 specialized dialect handlers
5. **Reporting Lineage**: Maintain traceability with RepoReportEcho_092425 anchor

## Agent Behavior Guidelines

### Code Standards
- Always validate input data before processing
- Generate checksums for all output files
- Follow the dialect-specific conventions in each branch
- Maintain consistent error handling across all modules
- Use structured logging for audit trails

### File Organization
- `/dialects/` - Dialect-specific processors
- `/verification/` - Core verification logic
- `/reports/` - Output generation modules
- `/data/cve/` - CVE manifest storage
- `/agents/` - Agent-specific configurations

### Security Considerations
- Validate all CVE manifest inputs
- Sanitize output data for web rendering
- Generate cryptographic checksums for integrity
- Log all verification operations for audit

### Output Requirements
- All reports must include timestamp and checksum
- Generate outputs in CSV, MD, and HTML formats
- Maintain RepoReportEcho_092425 lineage identifier
- Include verification metadata in all outputs

## Integration Points
- GitHub Pages deployment for dashboard rendering
- Cross-dialect communication through standardized interfaces
- Checksum validation across all output formats
- Agent coordination through shared state management
