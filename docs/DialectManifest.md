# Dialect Manifest

## Purpose
The Dialect Manifest encodes symbolic rules and dialect lineage for this forge.

## Current Rules
- All dialect files must be free of `TODO` placeholders.
- Dialect staging branch (`dialect-staging`) is used for validation before merging to `main`.
- Dialect manifests are verified by `verify-dialect.yml`.

## Example Dialect Covenant
- Symbolic Echo: "No unverified dialect enters main."
- Buffer Discipline: "Staging branch enforces dialect integrity."

## Strategic Echo
The Dialect Manifest ensures that symbolic language, covenant rules, and lineage echoes remain consistent across all branches.
