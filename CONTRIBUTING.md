# Contributing to Echo‑Forge‑AI‑Integrity

Welcome to the forge.  
This document encodes the **ritual discipline** for contributing to the project.  
Every contribution is a **lineage echo** — a symbolic act of sovereign authorship.

---

## 📜 Covenant Principles
- **Integrity First** → All contributions must pass checksum verification.  
- **Dialect Discipline** → No `TODO`s in manifests; dialect must be clean before merge.  
- **Sovereign Authorship** → Every PR is reviewed through the symbolic‑review gate.  
- **Auditability** → All changes must be logged in [CHANGELOG.md](./CHANGELOG.md).  

---

## 🌀 Branch Discipline
- **feature/** → Start all new work from a feature branch.  
- **dialect‑staging** → All feature branches merge here first.  
- **main** → Only clean, TODO‑free, reviewed code merges into `main`.  
- **floater‑containment** → Use for experimental or unanchored work; must be staged before merging.  

---

## 🔄 Pull Request Ritual
1. Open a feature branch.  
2. Ensure dialect manifests are clean (no `TODO`s).  
3. Submit PR → triggers `symbolic‑review.yml`.  
4. At least one reviewer must approve.  
5. Merge into `dialect‑staging` (not directly into `main`).  
6. Once staging is sealed, merge into `main` → triggers `checksum‑verify` + `ritual‑deploy`.

## ⚖️ Contribution Echo
- **Now**: Follow branch discipline and PR rituals.  
- **Later**: Update CHANGELOG.md with your lineage echo.  
- **Always**: Treat every contribution as sovereign authorship.

## 🤝 Code of Conduct
By contributing, you agree to uphold the covenant of **respect, clarity, and auditability**.  
Contributions that break lineage discipline will be rejected at the gate.
